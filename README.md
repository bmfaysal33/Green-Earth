### Answer to the following questions-


#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

#### Difference Between `var`, `let`, and `const`

#### `var`
- Function-scoped.
- Can be redeclared and updated.
- Hoisted with an initial value of `undefined`.
- Not recommended in modern JavaScript.

#### `let`
- Block-scoped.
- Cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
- Can be updated.
- Hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone).

#### `const`
- Block-scoped.
- Cannot be redeclared or updated.
- Must be assigned a value at declaration.
- Objects and arrays declared with `const` can still have their internal values modified.



#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

**`map()`**
- Returns a **new array**.
- Transforms each element.
- Used when you want to **modify** data.

**`forEach()`**
- Does **not** return a new array.
- Just loops through items and performs an action.
- Used for **side effects** (e.g. logging, updating UI).

**`filter()`**
- Returns a **new array**.
- Keeps only elements that pass a condition.
- Used for **filtering/selecting** data.


#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

Arrow functions are a shorter, cleaner way to write functions in JavaScript.  
They use the `=>` syntax and do **not** have their own `this`, `arguments`, or `prototype`.

**Example:**
``
const add = (a, b) => a + b; ``

    


#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Destructuring assignment lets you extract values from arrays or properties from objects and store them in variables using a clean, shorthand syntax.

#### **Array Destructuring**
``
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [a, b, c] = numbers; // a=1, b=2, c=3 ``


#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Template literals are a modern way to create strings using backticks (``).  
They allow embedding variables and expressions directly inside the string using `${ }`.

#### **Example (Template Literal)**

const name = "Faysal";
const message = `Hello, ${name}`;
